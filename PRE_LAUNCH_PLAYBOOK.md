# FlexIt Pre-Launch Tactical Playbook
## Nikita Bier's Instagram + Social Media Strategy

This is your step-by-step guide to execute the hyper-local, viral launch strategy that Nikita Bier used with tbh and Gas.

---

## PHASE 1: INSTAGRAM MYSTERY ACCOUNTS (Week 1)
**Goal:** Build anticipation and curiosity in specific communities

### Step 1: Create Community-Specific Instagram Accounts

Create **4-5 Instagram accounts**, each targeting a specific crypto community:

1. **@flexit.solana** → Solana Discord/CT community
2. **@flexit.ct** → General Crypto Twitter degens
3. **@flexit.friendtech** → friend.tech refugees
4. **@flexit.farcaster** → Farcaster power users

### Step 2: Set Up Each Account

**Profile Setup:**
- **Profile Picture:** FlexIt logo with subtle green glow
- **Bio:**
  ```
  You're invited.
  March 15.
  Stay tuned 🔥
  ```
- **Keep accounts PRIVATE** (this is critical!)
- **0 posts** (keep it mysterious)
- **Highlights:** None yet

### Step 3: Build Your Target List

For each account, identify your target users:

**Solana Discord (@flexit.solana):**
1. Join 10-15 active Solana Discord servers
2. Export member lists (use tools like Discord.id or manual search)
3. Find members who:
   - Have Twitter in bio
   - Post about Solana regularly
   - Have 500+ followers
   - Are active (posted in last 7 days)

**Crypto Twitter (@flexit.ct):**
1. Search Twitter for keywords:
   - "friend.tech rugged"
   - "creator coins"
   - "SocialFi"
   - "$SOL alpha"
2. Build list of 500-1000 active CT accounts
3. Find their Instagram profiles (many link in Twitter bio)

**friend.tech (@flexit.friendtech):**
1. Go to friend.tech leaderboards
2. Find top 200 creators
3. Track down their Instagram accounts
4. Focus on those who've complained about rugs

**Farcaster (@flexit.farcaster):**
1. Find top Farcaster users on Warpcast
2. Export their connected social profiles
3. Build Instagram target list

### Step 4: The Follow Campaign (Days 1-5)

**Daily Quota Per Account:**
- Follow 100-150 users per day
- Stagger throughout the day (use automation tools like Jarvee or Later carefully)
- Mix up timing (not all at 9am)

**Important Rules:**
- Don't accept any follow requests yet
- Don't post anything
- Don't DM anyone
- Let curiosity build

**What Happens:**
Users see:
1. A private account followed them
2. Mysterious bio: "You're invited. March 15. Stay tuned 🔥"
3. They request to follow back (20-30% will)
4. You don't accept (builds more curiosity)

**Expected Results After 5 Days:**
- 500-750 follow requests per account
- People asking "what is this?" in Discord/Twitter
- Organic word-of-mouth starting

---

## PHASE 2: THE COORDINATED REVEAL (Day 6-7)
**Goal:** Massive simultaneous launch creating FOMO surge

### Step 1: Pre-Launch Countdown (March 14, 8pm PT)

**24 Hours Before Launch:**

**Instagram:**
- Accept 0 follow requests still
- Post first story (but still private):
  - Image: "24 hours"
  - Text: "Tomorrow changes everything"
  - Swipe up: Nothing yet

**Twitter (Main Account @FlexIt or founder @ShivamSspirit):**
```
24 hours until something new drops.

Creator coins. No rugs. Built different.

If you're on the waitlist, check your email tomorrow at 3:45pm PT.

If you're not... you're fading.
```

**Discord/Telegram:**
- Send announcement in communities
- Create countdown bot
- Schedule voice chat for launch

### Step 2: The 30-Minute Warning (March 15, 3:30pm PT)

**Instagram:**
- Still haven't accepted follows
- Post story: "30 minutes"
- Building anticipation to peak

**Twitter:**
```
30 minutes.

Every waitlist member gets access simultaneously.

This is how you launch a product.
Not with a drip. With a flood.

3:45pm PT - check your email.
4:00pm PT - we're live.
```

**Email (to waitlist):**
Subject: "Your FlexIt access - 30 minutes"

```
You're on the list.

In 30 minutes, everyone gets in together.

Position: #[XX]
Launch: 4:00pm PT sharp
Access link arrives at: 3:45pm

Get ready.

P.S. - Share your referral link now if you want to move up before launch
[REFERRAL_LINK]
```

### Step 3: THE COORDINATED SURGE (March 15, 3:45pm PT)

**15 Minutes Before Launch - The Simultaneous Reveal:**

**Instagram (ALL ACCOUNTS SIMULTANEOUSLY):**

1. **Accept ALL follow requests at once** (3:45pm PT exactly)
   - Use scheduling tool to accept all at same time
   - Creates notification flood

2. **Update Bio:**
   ```
   FlexIt: Creator coins that can't rug

   Join the waitlist 👇
   [LINK]

   March 15, 4pm PT - Live
   ```

3. **First Post (all accounts):**
   - Image: FlexIt logo + "We're Live"
   - Caption:
     ```
     Stop getting rugged.

     Creator coins where reputation is staked on-chain.
     Every post = token. Every creator = asset.

     Join 100+ OGs on the waitlist.
     Launch: Today 4pm PT

     Link in bio 🔥

     #FlexIt #SocialFi #Solana
     ```

4. **First Story:**
   - Countdown: "15 minutes until launch"
   - Swipe up to waitlist link

**Why This Works:**
- Every person who requested to follow gets notification AT THE SAME TIME
- Creates "everyone's talking about this" moment
- FOMO peaks when it's simultaneous
- Algorithms favor sudden engagement spikes

### Step 4: LAUNCH (March 15, 4:00pm PT)

**Access Email (to waitlist):**
Subject: "You're in 🔥"

```
FlexIt is live.

[BIG GREEN BUTTON: Launch App]

You're position #[XX].
Your perks:
- OG Founder Badge (on-chain forever)
- 5% revenue share on all referrals
- Priority handle reservation

Share your link to unlock VIP features:
[REFERRAL_LINK]

Let's build.
```

**Twitter Storm (Schedule 10+ tweets for 4:00-4:30pm):**

Tweet 1 (4:00pm):
```
FlexIt is live.

Creator coins that can't rug you.

If you're tired of getting dumped on by anon founders, this is your moment.

[LINK]
```

Tweet 2 (4:05pm):
```
100+ creators just launched their first no-rug tokens.

Their reputation is on the line.
They literally can't sell and abandon you.

This is how SocialFi should work.

[LINK]
```

Tweet 3 (4:10pm):
```
friend.tech: Creators can dump anytime
FlexIt: Tokens are locked, reputation staked

One is a rug factory.
One is the future.

Choose wisely.

[LINK]
```

Tweet 4-10: User testimonials, screenshots, metrics, etc.

**Instagram Stories (Every 30 minutes for 4 hours):**
- User screenshots
- Signup numbers ("87 joined in last hour")
- Testimonials
- Features showcase
- Referral leaderboard

**Result:**
- Concentrated attention spike
- Trend on Crypto Twitter (coordinate with influencers to retweet at 4pm)
- Instagram explore page algorithm boost
- FOMO cascade as people share

---

## PHASE 3: COMMUNITY-SPECIFIC CAMPAIGNS (Ongoing)

### Strategy: Launch in Communities Sequentially

**Don't** launch everywhere at once broadly.
**Do** saturate individual communities one at a time.

### Week 1: Solana Discord Community

**Goal:** Get 40%+ of active Solana Discord degens on FlexIt

**Tactics:**
1. **Partner with Discord mods** (give them Diamond Founder status)
2. **Create Solana Discord leaderboard:**
   - "Top 10 Solana Discord members on FlexIt"
   - Public shame FOMO: "Join 47 other Solana Discord OGs"
3. **Discord bot:**
   - `/flexit-rank` command shows your position vs other server members
   - Creates competition
4. **Exclusive Solana Discord perks:**
   - Access waitlist: `flexitwaitlist.com?c=solana-discord`
   - Shows: "Join 89 other Solana Discord members already in"

**Success Metric:** 40% of active Solana Discord members join

### Week 2: Crypto Twitter (CT)

**Don't move to CT until Solana Discord hits 40% density**

**Tactics:**
1. **Thread announcing CT expansion:**
   ```
   After crushing it with Solana Discord (127 OGs joined in 3 days),
   we're opening FlexIt to CT.

   Same deal. Creator coins that can't rug.

   If you're tired of getting dumped on, this is your moment.

   [LINK with ?c=ct parameter]
   ```
2. **CT-specific leaderboard**
3. **Coordinate with CT influencers:**
   - Give them early access + revenue share
   - They tweet at coordinated time (e.g., Sunday 8pm when CT is most active)
4. **CT badge/flair**

**Success Metric:** 300+ CT members in first 48 hours

### Week 3-4: friend.tech Refugees, Farcaster, etc.

Repeat strategy:
1. Saturate one community
2. Show density metrics
3. Create FOMO
4. Move to next

---

## PHASE 4: VIRAL LOOP OPTIMIZATION

### Make Sharing THE Core Action

**Current Implementation:**
✅ Referral link visible after signup
✅ "Skip the wait" with 3 referrals
✅ One-click Twitter sharing

**Optimize Further:**

### 1. Pre-Fill Twitter Share Message (Currently Done)

Your current implementation:
```typescript
const shareOnTwitter = () => {
  const text = encodeURIComponent(`Just joined @FlexIt beta...`);
  const url = encodeURIComponent(successData?.referralUrl || '');
  window.open(`https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=${text}&url=${url}`, '_blank');
};
```

**Optimization:** Test different messages, find highest CTR

**Test These Variants:**

**Variant A (Emotional Pain):**
```
friend.tech rugged me twice.

FlexIt can't rug - creator tokens are locked, reputation staked.

Finally.

Join the waitlist:
```

**Variant B (Social Proof):**
```
Just joined 200+ alpha hunters on @FlexIt.

Creator coins that can't dump on you.

If you're tired of rugs, you're early:
```

**Variant C (Status):**
```
Position #47 on @FlexIt waitlist.

OG Founder Badge locked in.

Creator tokens launching March 15.

Don't fade:
```

**Variant D (FOMO):**
```
12 spots left on @FlexIt waitlist.

First 100 = OG Founder status forever.

If you miss this, you're actually down bad:
```

**A/B Test:** Rotate these and track which gets most clicks/signups

### 2. Add More Sharing Channels

**Currently:** Twitter only

**Add:**

**Telegram:**
```typescript
const shareOnTelegram = () => {
  const text = encodeURIComponent(`Just joined FlexIt - creator coins that can't rug\n\n${successData?.referralUrl}`);
  window.open(`https://t.me/share/url?url=${text}`, '_blank');
};
```

**Discord (Copy for Discord):**
```typescript
const copyForDiscord = () => {
  const text = `Just joined FlexIt - creator coins that can't rug\n\nJoin the waitlist: ${successData?.referralUrl}`;
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
  toast.success('Copied! Paste in Discord');
};
```

**Farcaster:**
```typescript
const shareOnFarcaster = () => {
  const text = encodeURIComponent(`Creator coins that can't rug\n\n${successData?.referralUrl}`);
  window.open(`https://warpcast.com/~/compose?text=${text}`, '_blank');
};
```

### 3. Gamification Enhancements

**Current:** 1/3/10 referral tiers

**Add:**

**Leaderboard (Public):**
- `/leaderboard` page showing top 20 referrers
- Updates in real-time
- Shows: username (or email prefix), referrals, rewards unlocked

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Add to your waitlist API
GET /api/waitlist/leaderboard
Returns:
[
  { rank: 1, user: "crypt****", referrals: 47, tier: "Diamond Founder" },
  { rank: 2, user: "alph****", referrals: 38, tier: "Diamond Founder" },
  ...
]
```

**Why:**
- Public leaderboard = status competition
- People share to climb ranks
- Creates natural K-factor boost

**Weekly Prizes:**
- Top referrer each week gets:
  - Featured on main Twitter account
  - Lifetime VIP status
  - $100 USDC
  - Private 1:1 with founder

### 4. Referral Progress Bar

**Add to success screen:**

```tsx
<div className="bg-white/5 rounded-xl p-4 mb-4">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-2">
    <span className="text-white/60 text-sm">Next Reward</span>
    <span className="text-accent-green text-sm font-semibold">
      {currentReferrals}/3 referrals
    </span>
  </div>
  <div className="w-full bg-white/10 rounded-full h-2">
    <div
      className="bg-accent-green h-2 rounded-full transition-all"
      style={{ width: `${(currentReferrals / 3) * 100}%` }}
    />
  </div>
  <p className="text-white/40 text-xs mt-2">
    {3 - currentReferrals} more to unlock instant access
  </p>
</div>
```

**Psychology:** Progress bars create completion desire

---

## METRICS TO TRACK DAILY

### Critical Nikita Bier Metrics:

**1. K-Factor (Virality Coefficient):**
```
K = (Number of invites sent per user) × (Conversion rate of invites)

Target: K > 2.0
Gas achieved: K = 7+
```

**Track:**
- Average invites per user
- Invite conversion rate
- Overall K-factor

**If K < 1.5:** Your product won't grow virally
**If K > 2.0:** You're on track for viral explosion

**2. Time to First Share:**
```
Target: <60 seconds after signup
```

**Track:**
- Median time from signup to first share
- % of users who share within 1 minute

**If > 2 minutes:** Referral UX needs improvement

**3. Community Density:**
```
Target: >40% of specific community on platform
```

**Track per community:**
- Solana Discord: X / estimated_active_members
- CT: X / target_list_size
- friend.tech: X / top_creators

**If < 40%:** Don't expand to next community yet

**4. Launch Day Metrics:**
```
Target: >40% of waitlist active in first hour
```

**Track on March 15:**
- 4:00pm: How many opened email
- 4:00-5:00pm: How many logged in
- 4:00-6:00pm: How many shared
- 4:00-midnight: How many new signups from viral sharing

**5. Referral Conversion Funnel:**
```
Track:
- Referral link clicks
- Email signups from referrals
- Conversion rate per sharer
```

**Optimize for:**
- High click-through rate (>30%)
- High signup rate (>60% of clicks)

## RED FLAGS / WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ **Don't:**
1. Launch broad instead of hyper-local
2. Accept Instagram follows before reveal day
3. Over-explain the product (cut features ruthlessly)
4. Make sharing optional (it's THE action)
5. Move to next community before hitting 40% density
6. Ignore K-factor metrics
7. Delay referral ask
8. Use boring, technical copy

✅ **Do:**
1. Launch in ONE community at a time
2. Build mystery on Instagram first
3. Demonstrate value in 3 seconds
4. Make sharing frictionless (one tap)
5. Saturate communities before expanding
6. Obsess over K-factor daily
7. Show referral benefits immediately
8. Use emotional, status-driven copy

## EMERGENCY PLAYBOOK

### If K-Factor < 1.0 After 48 Hours:

**Diagnosis:**
- People aren't sharing
- Referral incentives too weak
- Sharing UX too complex

**Fixes:**
1. **Increase urgency:** "Only 20 spots left" (even if not true)
2. **Stronger rewards:** 1 referral = instant access (down from 3)
3. **Simplify sharing:** Remove all friction, one button
4. **Pre-fill everything:** Don't make users write anything
5. **Add leaderboard prizes:** Weekly $100 USDC to top referrer

### If Community Density < 20% After 1 Week:

**Diagnosis:**
- Wrong community target
- Not enough initial push
- Product-market fit issues

**Fixes:**
1. **Restart with different community:** Try friend.tech refugees instead
2. **Stronger initial push:** Partner with influencers
3. **Revisit messaging:** A/B test different pain points
4. **Manual outreach:** DM top 100 people in community directly

### If Launch Day Flops (<40% Active):

**Diagnosis:**
- Email went to spam
- Launch time wrong
- No coordinated push

**Fixes:**
1. **Re-launch:** Pick new date, 7 days later
2. **Manual notifications:** Twitter DMs, Discord pings, etc.
3. **Stronger FOMO:** "Last chance" messaging
4. **Influencer coordination:** Get 10+ influencers to tweet simultaneously

---

## CLOSING THOUGHTS

Nikita Bier's strategy works because it's rooted in psychology:

1. **Mystery** creates curiosity
2. **Scarcity** drives FOMO
3. **Social proof** validates decisions
4. **Status** motivates sharing
5. **Belonging** creates retention

Your goal isn't to explain FlexIt perfectly.
Your goal is to make people FEEL like they're missing out if they don't join.

Ship fast. Test small. Learn quick.

Good luck 🚀
